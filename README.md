# B4B - Brightway for Beginners

These are the materials used in a 8-hour course to learn Brightway2, developed by Massimo Pizzol at Aalborg University and tested once in the Spring 2018.

The **overall learning objective** is to be able to use Brightway2 to a level comparable to other commercial LCA software. For more details on the course content see the pdf file B4B18_docs.pdf

_**IMPORTANT NOTE: this course is given live and was not developed to be an online course, these are only the materials, so most of the pedagogical explainations are missing.**_

To use these materials, the prerequisites are: 

- Prior python knowledge and/or some elements of programming (main data structures in python, lists, dictionary, variable, function, class, loops etc.) 
- Prior LCA knowledge (matrix calculation, LCA terminology e.g. activities and exchanges...). 

The repository includes the following course materials:

- a pdf file with the plan and lectures of the 2018 edition (B4B18_docs.pdf)
- numbered python scripts (.py files) and jupyter notebook scripts (.ipynb files)
- Some excel files for the import exercises.
